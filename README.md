# VB.NET Security Module - Security Simplified!
Welcome to the GitHub page for my Security Module for VB.NET. The intention of this module is to provide functions that can be used for the security of VB.NET programs. These functions are simple and execute very quickly, so there will be little to no impact on the performance of your program!

## Features

- MD5 Hashing - Done & Documented
- SHA-1 Hashing - Done & Documented
- SHA-2 Hashing (256, 384, 512) - Done & Documented
- Triple DES Encryption - Done
- DES Encryption - Planned
- AES Encryption (128, 256, 512) - Planned
- Blowfish Encryption - Planned
- Serpent Encryption - Planned



Other features may be added as I develop this Module further.

NOTE: As of 23rd August 2020, I will no longer include RSA Encryption in this module until the function has been improved.
